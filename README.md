# Mastercomfig-All-in-one-for-Vortex-Mod-Manager
A single downloadable .7z used with Vortex Mod Manager to install Mastercomfig with selection of presets and addons.

Install by dropping the file into the drop area in the mods tab of the Team Fortress 2 vortex extension.

You will still need to install modules.cfg and other configs manually.
